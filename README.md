Datasets for course project

The datasets in this repository have been created for use by students in their team project on international trade and trade policies. The data sets have been compiled using various official sources of national and international statistics. However they are presented in a fashion that is easy to use, so that the full set up process is not documented here. Accordingly, the data does not claim to exactly reflect any official statistical figures and should, hence, not be used or referred to in any context outside the course and project.
